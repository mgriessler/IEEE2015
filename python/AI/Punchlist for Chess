TO DO

Read first:
  ADD TO THIS LIST WHENEVER YOU FIND SOMETHING WORTH ADDRESSING
  I know we don't have alot of time, but everyone's work so far has been great. We can do it, that I'm sure. 
  IMPORTANT: Commmunicate to teammembers what exactly what inputs and information you need them to give you. We are on a 
  bit of a time crunch so if we can avoid people working on tasks that are unecessary or overcomplicated, that is 
  only going to help us create something awesome to show to UF, Discovery Channel, and most importantly, ourselves.
  SUPER IMPORTANT: Make sure your code accounts for failure or an error, the robot needs to respond to bugs and not 
  shut down and stop completely (for the sake of time we can't catch everything, this is more of a long term thing
  to take into account)

Computer Vision:
  -Segment each square and store the square in some kind of data structure
  -store color and type of piece in that square "object"
  -come up with way to continually update the pieces current location on the board
  -find way to eliminate piece 
      - only time that a piece is removed is when a piece from the other team is in the same
        square as the other team's piece from the previous turn (signifies the piece was "captured")
  -give back coordinate of centroid of piece so arm knows where to move
  -establish height and coordinate of where arm will move to take a picture of the board between moves
  -take info from image and output a Forsyth-Edwards string
  -identify proper colors regardless of lighting
  
AI: 
  -make sure the allowable moves are properly implemented and accounted for 
      -example: knight moves in L patter, bishops move diagonally...etc
  
Arm:
  -smooth movement with joints and rotation
  -establishing the right height for picking up, moving, then placing the piece back on the board
    so that other pieces are not knocked over
  -can properly return to a waiting position while human makes move
  -can be held in place over the board still enough to take as clear of an image of the board as possible
  
End Effector:
  -finalize design 
  -attach to robot
  -proper grippers so that we don't drop pieces during movement
  -emphasis on what grippers will be used to pick up pieces since the end effector in this case only has to worry 
    picking things up and putting them back down
  
Other things to keep in mind:
  -make sure we are using enough force so that the pieces are not crushed or slip out from grasp
  -we are able to set up robot in a way the arm can reach the end of the board
